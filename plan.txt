Plan

1. User Management
Implement CRUD operations for users.
Define roles (e.g., Admin, Organizer, Attendee) and permissions.
Add authentication and authorization using Spring Security.
2. Event Booking System
Implement an endpoint to allow users to book events.
Add constraints for maximum attendees and avoid overbooking.
Include cancellation and refund policies.
3. Notification System
Integrate email notifications (e.g., for booking confirmations, updates, and reminders).
Use a service like Mailgun or MailerLite for sending notifications.
4. Advanced Query Features
Add filtering and search functionality for events (e.g., by date, location, or category).
Implement pagination and sorting for event listings.
5. API Documentation
Use Swagger/OpenAPI for generating API documentation.
Ensure all endpoints are well-documented and testable via Swagger UI.
6. Database Enhancements
Migrate from H2 to a production-grade database (e.g., PostgreSQL or MySQL).
Add database indexing for faster query performance.
7. Frontend Integration
Build a frontend (e.g., React/Angular/Vue) to interact with the backend.
Design user-friendly interfaces for event creation, booking, and management.
8. Payment Integration
Integrate a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) for paid events.
Handle payment receipts and transaction records.
9. Analytics and Reporting
Add endpoints to generate reports (e.g., total bookings, revenue, popular events).
Implement a dashboard for organizers to view event performance.
10. Unit and Integration Testing
Write unit tests for services and controllers using JUnit and Mockito.
Add integration tests to ensure the system works end-to-end.
11. Deployment
Dockerize the application.
Deploy to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP).
Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated builds and deployments.
